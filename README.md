   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/a7medfat7y10/StudentProgressTrackerAPI.git
   cd StudentProgressTrackerAPI
   ```

2. **Restore NuGet packages**
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Update database connection string**
   - Open `appsettings.json`
   - Update the `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection` to match your SQL Server setup
     
4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

5. **Access the API**
   - API Base URL: `https://localhost:7094`
   - Swagger Documentation: `https://localhost:5001/7094`

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Design Patterns Used

**Repository Pattern**: Implemented to abstract data access logic and provide a clean separation between business logic and data persistence.

**Dependency Injection**: Leveraged ASP.NET Core's built-in DI container for loose coupling and better testability.

**Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic is encapsulated in service classes, keeping controllers thin and focused on HTTP concerns.

### Project Structure
```
StudentProgressTrackerAPI/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Controllers/           # API endpoint controllers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Models/               # Domain models and DTOs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Services/             # Business logic services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Data/                 # Entity Framework context and configurations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Migrations/           # Database migration files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DTOs/           # Extension methods and Dtos
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Middleware/           # Custom middleware components
```

## üîê Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Token Authentication** : Built-in Identity in .NET 9.0
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Supports Teacher and Administrator roles with different data access levels
- **Authorization Middleware**: Uses JWT `sub` claim or client IP to uniquely identify callers.
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation using Data Annotations and FluentValidation
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Entity Framework Core parameterized queries prevent SQL injection attacks
- **Data Sanitization**: All input data is sanitized before processing
- **Rate Limiting Middleware**: 
  - Limits each user/IP to 100 requests per minute.
  - Tracks request windows using an in-memory dictionary.
  - Returns standard headers:  
    `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`
  - Responds with **HTTP 429** and helpful message when the limit is exceeded.
- **Global Exception Handling**:
  - All unhandled exceptions are logged and returned in a consistent error format.
  - Avoids stack traces being exposed to the client.

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

- **Efficient Filtering and Pagination**: All list endpoints are paginated and filterable by grade, subject, or date.
- **Query Optimization**: Key fields like `Grade`, `StudentId`, `Subject` are indexed in the database schema.
- **Async/Await**: Used throughout for non-blocking DB and IO operations.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and overload by rejecting excessive requests gracefully.
- **Async Handling**: Middleware and all service layers use async I/O for scalable request handling.
- **Global Error Handler**: Prevents unnecessary crashes and maintains consistent response latency.

### Database Performance
- **Efficient Queries**: LINQ queries optimized with proper includes and projections
- **Indexing Strategy**: Database indexes on frequently queried columns (StudentId, Grade, Subject)
- **Pagination**: Efficient pagination using Skip/Take with total count optimization

### Async/Await Patterns
- All I/O operations use async/await for better scalability
- Database operations are non-blocking


## üìê Architecture Decisions & Patterns Used

- **Layered Architecture**: Clean separation between Controllers, Services, Repositories, DTOs, and Models.
- **Repository Pattern**: Used for database access abstraction, making it testable and replaceable.
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic independent of controller and data access concerns.
- **DTO Pattern**: To decouple internal domain models from API contracts, enhancing security and flexibility.
- **AutoMapper**: Simplifies transformation between Models and DTOs.
- **Validation Layer**: FluentValidation used to separate and centralize input validation logic.

## üè¢ Integration Considerations for Enterprise Environments

- **OpenAPI (Swagger) Spec**: Exposes full API contract for integration with frontend or external systems.
- **Role-Based Access**: Easily extendable to connect with identity providers (e.g., Azure AD, Okta).
- **Modular Design**: Each layer is testable and loosely coupled, allowing it to be containerized or extracted.
- **Environment Configs**: Supports different environments (dev/stage/prod) through `appsettings.{env}.json`.
- **Token-Based Auth**: Compatible with OAuth2 flows and bearer token schemes used in enterprise APIs.
- **Health Checks & Logging**: Extendable using ASP.NET Core Diagnostics + Serilog or Application Insights.

## üåê Scalability & Deployment Notes

- **Stateless Services**: Designed for horizontal scaling across containers or VMs.
- **Database Migrations**: EF Core Migrations + seed data enable consistent deployment across environments.

## ü§ñ AI Tool Usage & Prompt Engineering Methodology

### Tool Used:
- **ChatGPT**

### Prompt Strategy:
- Started with general design prompts and then refined to:  
  - _‚ÄúAdd pagination and filtering to students endpoint‚Äù_
  - _‚ÄúGenerate CSV export of student data in .NET Core‚Äù_
  - _‚ÄúSecure endpoint using mock JWT token and RBAC policy‚Äù_
- Generating seed data logic
- Prompted for examples of:
  - Proper DTO setup

### Critical Thinking & Review:
- All code generated by AI was reviewed, refined, or replaced to meet business logic or performance needs.
- Rejected suggestions when they lacked clarity on RBAC or state management.
- Used domain expertise to align AI output with enterprise-scale expectations.

### Learning Outcome:
- AI accelerated setup and initial scaffolding
- Helped reduce boilerplate
- Encouraged deeper understanding of scalable .NET API design
